# üìä Sorting Algorithms

Welcome to the **Sorting** section of this repository!  
This directory contains a collection of widely used sorting algorithms, implemented for learning, practice, and interview preparation.

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, used to arrange data in a specific order (usually ascending or descending). Understanding how different sorting algorithms work helps in writing efficient code and solving a wide range of problems.

## üì¶ Algorithms Implemented

| Sorting Algorithm    | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort          | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.          |
| Insertion Sort       | Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements correctly. |
| Selection Sort       | Repeatedly selects the smallest element and places it at the correct index. |
| Merge Sort           | A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits, sorts, and merges.              |
| Quick Sort           | Uses partitioning to sort elements around a pivot efficiently.              |
| Heap Sort            | Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.                         |
| Radix Sort           | A non-comparative sort that sorts integers digit by digit.                  |

## üß™ How to Run

Make sure you have a C compiler installed. Then:

```bash
gcc bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
./bubble_sort
```

Repeat similarly for other files.
