# 🌲 Tree Algorithms in DAA

Welcome to the **Tree Algorithms** section of this repository! This folder includes problems and transformations based on **tree data structures**, currently focused on **binary trees**, with plans to expand into other tree types (like AVL, heaps, and general trees).

## ✅ Problems Implemented

| S.No | Algorithm Name           | Description                                                                  |
|:----:|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Array to Binary Tree     | Converts a given array into a binary tree using level-order insertion.      |
| 2    | Binary Tree to Array     | Converts a binary tree into an array using level-order traversal.           |


## 🔧 How to Use

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `Tree` folder.
3. Compile and run using:

```bash
gcc array_to_tree.c -o array_to_tree
./array_to_tree

Repeat for other files (e.g., binary_tree_to_array.c)

## ✅ Contributing

     Add traversal algorithms (inorder, preorder, postorder)

     Add conversions between tree types (e.g., BST ↔ Array)

     Add tree-based problem solutions (e.g., height, diameter, lowest common ancestor)
