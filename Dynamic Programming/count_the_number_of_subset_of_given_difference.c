/*
    Problem Statement:
    -------------------
    Given an array of positive integers and a target difference (diff), count the number of ways
    to partition the array into two subsets such that the **difference between the sum** of the two subsets is equal to `diff`.

    That is, count the number of subsets such that:
        |sum(S1) - sum(S2)| = diff

    This is commonly solved by converting it to a subset sum problem using the formula:

        sum(S1) - sum(S2) = diff
        sum(S1) + sum(S2) = total_sum
        --------------------------------
        => 2 * sum(S1) = total_sum + diff
        => sum(S1) = (total_sum + diff) / 2

    So now, the task reduces to:
        Find number of subsets with sum = (total_sum + diff)/2

    Constraints:
    - total_sum + diff must be even, otherwise no valid subset.

    Example:
    Input: arr[] = {5, 8, 12, 4, 10}, diff = 1  
    Output: 3
