# 🔗 Linked List Algorithms

Welcome to the **Linked List** section of this repository!  
This directory focuses on solving fundamental and advanced problems related to linked lists, a crucial data structure in programming.

## 📌 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:

- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Next**: A pointer/reference to another node (depending on the type of linked list).

Linked lists can be singly, doubly, or circular, each with its own use cases and advantages.

## 💡 Problem Implemented

So far, we have implemented the following linked list algorithm:

1. **Reversal of a Linked List**  
   This classic problem reverses the order of nodes in a linked list.  
   We provide two approaches:
   - **Iterative**: Uses a loop with constant space.
   - **Recursive**: Uses recursion and the call stack to reverse the list.

## 🚧 What's Coming Next?

We will continue to expand this section with a variety of important linked list problems, such as:

- Detecting loops in linked lists
- Merging two sorted lists
- Finding the middle node
- Deleting nodes by position or value
- Removing duplicates
- And many more...

Stay tuned for more useful and interview-relevant linked list algorithms!
