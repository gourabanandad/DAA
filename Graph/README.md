# Graph Data Structure - DFS Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) for graph traversal in C.

## Current Implementation

### `dfs.c`
- Implements Depth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal
- Features:
  - Graph representation using adjacency list
  - Recursive DFS implementation
  - Visited nodes tracking to avoid cycles
  - Sample graph creation and traversal demonstration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd graph-data-structure
   ```

2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc dfs.c -o dfs
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./dfs
   ```

## Future Plans

This is currently a basic implementation. Planned enhancements include:
- [ ] Breadth-First Search (BFS) implementation
- [ ] More graph representations (adjacency matrix, edge list)
- [ ] Weighted graph support
- [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path
- [ ] More comprehensive test cases
