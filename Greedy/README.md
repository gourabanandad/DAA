# ‚ö° Greedy Algorithms in DAA

Welcome to the **Greedy Algorithms** section of this repository! Here, you'll find implementations of popular greedy algorithms commonly encountered in algorithmic challenges, interviews, and problem-solving tasks.

## üß† What is a Greedy Algorithm?

A **Greedy Algorithm** solves problems by making the **locally optimal choice** at each step with the hope of finding the **global optimum**. It works well when the problem satisfies:

- **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a series of locally optimal choices.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The problem can be broken down into subproblems which can be solved independently and combined.

|:----:|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1    | Activity Selection              | Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.                    | O(n log n)          |
| 2    | Fractional Knapsack             | Maximize total value by taking fractions based on value/weight ratio.       | O(n log n)          |
| 3    | Job Sequencing with Deadlines   | Schedule jobs within deadlines to maximize total profit.                    | O(n¬≤) or O(n log n) |
| 4    | Prim‚Äôs Algorithm (MST)          | Find Minimum Spanning Tree using greedy edge selection.                     | O(V¬≤)               |
| 5    | Huffman Coding                  | Generate optimal prefix codes based on character frequency.                 | O(n log n)          |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

You can easily compile and run any of the programs in this folder. Follow these simple steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `.c` files.
3. Use the following commands to compile and run each program:

   For the **Activity Selection Problem**:
   ```bash
   gcc activity_selection.c -o activity_selection
   ./activity_selection

   Repeat similarly for other files.
Each program is designed to run in the terminal, where it will display the results of the greedy algorithm applied to the problem.
