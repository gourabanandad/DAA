# 🧮 Array Algorithms in DAA

Welcome to the **Array Algorithms** section of this repository! Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures, and solving problems efficiently using arrays is a key skill in programming, interviews, and competitive coding. This section is dedicated to showcasing a variety of algorithms and patterns that revolve around arrays.

## 🧠 Why Focus on Array Techniques?

Many real-world problems and coding questions boil down to effective array manipulation — whether it's finding subarray sums, searching for patterns, or optimizing traversal.
---

## ✅ Problems Implemented So Far

Here are some of the array problems already implemented in this directory:

- **Prefix Sum for Subarray Queries**  
  Efficiently computes the sum of elements between any two indices using precomputed cumulative sums.

- **Sliding Window – Maximum Sum Subarray (Fixed Size)**  
  Finds the subarray with the maximum sum of a given size `k` using an optimized windowing technique.

- **Two Pointers – Two Sum in Sorted Array**  
  Identifies whether a pair of numbers in a sorted array adds up to a given target using the two-pointers method.

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next?

This section will continue to grow! Future updates will include more array-based algorithms such as:

- Kadane’s Algorithm (Maximum Subarray Sum)
- Array Rearrangement and Partitioning Techniques
- Dutch National Flag Problem
- Sorting and Counting-based Problems
- And many more...

## 🛠️ How to Run the Programs

Each file is written in C and can be compiled and run from the terminal:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program

Replace filename.c with the actual program file.
